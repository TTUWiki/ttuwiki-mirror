	IT guys will get it.
	
	Attention, ladies and gentlemen! It looks like C language is not what we were thinking:
	* [[IDK0061|IDK0061 - Keel C ja objektorienteeritud programmeerimine]]
	* [[RAR0341|RAR0341 - Keel C ja objektorienteeritud programmeerimine]]
	* [[RAR1790|RAR1790 - Keel C ja objektorienteeritud programmeerimine]]
	
	Although I see how one can confuse C language with C++, it completely escapes me how can you confuse it with C#. It brings a good question whether people creating the study programme and lecturers are competent enough to be associated with IT in any way, let alone to teach.
