Вероятнее всего, энтузиазма за несколько лет поубавилось. Однако информация все равно интересная и полезная, особенно пригодится при написании контрольной по теории.</p><h2>Харьютусы</h2><p>На харьютусах подробно разжевывается решение всех задач. Если на них не ходить, то велика вероятность, что вы вообще не поймете, о чем идет речь на контрольной. С другой стороны, все решения есть в задачнике, поэтому можно и самом разобраться.</p><p>В последний харьютус перед контрольной г-ин Гордон сообщает, какие типы задач будут на контрольной.</p><p>Поскольку харьютусов 8 (после которых идут лабораторные), а лекций 16, материал на лекциях значительно отстает от того, что вы будете делать на харьютусах.</p><h2>Лабораторные</h2><p>Лабораторные заключаются в решение различных задач в MATLAB. По сути теперь вы узнаете, что всё, что вы делали вручную на бумаги, можно за несколько секунд сделать в MATLAB&#x2026; Огромный минус в том, что MATLAB вы вряд ли легко сможете поставить себе на компьютер. Другие альтернативы описаны ниже.</p><h2>Экзамен</h2><p>На экзамен идут только те, кто не смог получить общую оценку выше 1 (что на самом деле довольно сложно). Все правила допуска к экзамену довольно подробно описаны на страничке у г-на Гордона.</p><h2>Свободное программное обеспечение (Лабораторные)</h2><p>Есть несколько программ, о которых вам будет полезно знать:<br /></p><ul><li><a class="url http outside" href="http://www.sagemath.org/">sage</a> - отлично подходит для различных вычислений, в чем-то функциональность пересекается с MATLAB, но для теории систем мало подходит, так как для этого там ничего нет.</li><li><a class="url http outside" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-control/">python-control</a> - тут все понятно, вещь заточена именно для систем, но для всего остального подходит мало, да и всех приятных фишек sage тут нет.</li><li><strong><a class="url http outside" href="http://www.scilab.org/">Scilab</a></strong> - для нас практически полная альтернатива MATLAB. Если вас интересует только выполнение лабораторных, то можете не читать про sage и python-control</li></ul><h3>sage</h3><h4>Установка</h4><p>Скачать можно с <a class="url http outside" href="http://sagemath.org/">официального сайта</a>. Если для вашей платформы есть бинарник, то всё чудесно - качаете и используетсе. Для Debian почему-то его нет, придется компилировать&#x2026; Нет ничего страшного, весь процесс автоматизирован, но занимает несколько часов, поэтому оставляйте его на ночь. На моем средненьком лаптопе весь процесс длился около 8 часов.</p><h4>Занятие 0</h4><p>Отличия от MATLAB<br /></p><table class="user"><tr><th align="center">MATLAB </th><th align="center">sage </th></tr><tr><td>help command</td><td>help(command)</td></tr><tr><td>%</td><td># коментарии, как и все остальное, как в python</td></tr><tr><td>v = [1 2 3 4 3 2 1]</td><td>v = vector([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]) Если без vector(), тогда это список, а не вектор</td></tr><tr><td>v + 3</td><td>v + vector([3] * len(v))</td></tr><tr><td>A = [9 2 3; -1 3 4; 0 2 1]</td><td>A = matrix([[9, 2, 3], [-1, 3, 4], [0, 2, 1]])</td></tr><tr><td>A = [9 2 3; -1 3 4; 0 2 1]</td><td>A = matrix(3, [9, 2, 3, -1, 3, 4, 0, 2, 1])</td></tr><tr><td>At = A&#x2019;</td><td>At = A.transpose()</td></tr><tr><td>A(1,1)</td><td>A[0,0] - нумерация с нуля</td></tr><tr><td>A(3,3) = 4</td><td>A[2,2] = 4</td></tr><tr><td>row1 = 2:5</td><td>row1 = range(2, 6) - второе число не включается.

Я слабо понимаю, что творится в голове автором slicot. С одной стороны, его исходный код открыт, с другой стороны, разработчик хочет деньги в том случае, если вы используете slicot в коммерческих целях. При этом версия 4.5 выложена под лицензией GPL, что дает возможность распространять программу в любых целях, не платя автору ни цента.

	Говорят, что раньше г-ин Гордон превосходно вел свои лекции. Вероятнее всего, энтузиазма за несколько лет поубавилось. Однако информация все равно интересная и полезная, особенно пригодится при написании контрольной по теории.
	
	==Харьютусы
	На харьютусах подробно разжевывается решение всех задач. Если на них не ходить, то велика вероятность, что вы вообще не поймете, о чем идет речь на контрольной. С другой стороны, все решения есть в задачнике, поэтому можно и самом разобраться.
	
	В последний харьютус перед контрольной г-ин Гордон сообщает, какие типы задач будут на контрольной.
	
	Поскольку харьютусов 8 (после которых идут лабораторные), а лекций 16, материал на лекциях значительно отстает от того, что вы будете делать на харьютусах. 
	
	==Лабораторные
	Лабораторные заключаются в решение различных задач в MATLAB. По сути теперь вы узнаете, что всё, что вы делали вручную на бумаги, можно за несколько секунд сделать в MATLAB... Огромный минус в том, что MATLAB вы вряд ли легко сможете поставить себе на компьютер. Другие альтернативы описаны ниже.
	
	==Экзамен
	На экзамен идут только те, кто не смог получить общую оценку выше 1 (что на самом деле довольно сложно). Все правила допуска к экзамену довольно подробно описаны на страничке у г-на Гордона.
	
	==Свободное программное обеспечение (Лабораторные)
	Есть несколько программ, о которых вам будет полезно знать:
	 * [[http://www.sagemath.org/ sage]] - отлично подходит для различных вычислений, в чем-то функциональность пересекается с MATLAB, но для теории систем мало подходит, так как для этого там ничего нет.
	 * [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/python-control/ python-control]] - тут все понятно, вещь заточена именно для систем, но для всего остального подходит мало, да и всех приятных фишек sage тут нет.
	 * **[[http://www.scilab.org/ Scilab]]** - для нас практически полная альтернатива MATLAB. Если вас интересует только выполнение лабораторных, то можете не читать про sage и python-control
	
	=== sage
	
	====Установка
	Скачать можно с [[http://sagemath.org/ официального сайта]]. Если для вашей платформы есть бинарник, то всё чудесно - качаете и используетсе. Для Debian почему-то его нет, придется компилировать... Нет ничего страшного, весь процесс автоматизирован, но занимает несколько часов, поэтому оставляйте его на ночь. На моем средненьком лаптопе весь процесс длился около 8 часов.

	|conv(p1,p2)|p1*p2|
	
	Поскольку практически всё является объектом, можете смело ставить точку и нажимать TAB для автодополнения. Стоит отметить, что это довольно полезная фича, так как помнить названия всех функций нереально. Но, к сожалению, в **Scilab** большая часть функций живет сама по себе, такой метод не сработает, а жаль.
	
	====Занятие 1
	На этом нужная нам функциональность sage исчерпана, на следующих занятиях придется использовать что-то другое :)
	
	===python-control
	В целом работает сам по себе, но для некоторых действий (таких как tf) вам понадобится slicot. Я слабо понимаю, что творится в голове автором slicot. С одной стороны, его исходный код открыт, с другой стороны, разработчик хочет деньги в том случае, если вы используете slicot в коммерческих целях. При этом версия 4.5 выложена под лицензией GPL, что дает возможность распространять программу в любых целях, не платя автору ни цента. И тут вроде бы все логично, но в debian репозитории последняя версия - 5.0.
	
	Ладно, не суть.
	
	Устанавливаем [[http://slicot.org/ slicot]]:
	{{{
	sudo apt-get install libslicot0 libslicot-dev libslicot-doc
	}}}
	
	Устанавливаем [[https://github.com/avventi/Slycot slycot]]:
	{{{
	sudo apt-get build-dep python-scipy # для этого в /etc/apt/sources.list должен быть соответствующий deb-src репозиторий
	sudo python setup.py install
	}}}
	Вроде бы все, теперь python-control должен быть полнофункциональным.
	
	Запускаем:
	{{{
	ipython -pylab
	}}}
	Внутри
	{{{
	from control.matlab import *
	}}}
	Если все прошло без ошибок, то можно начинать рассматривать занятия :)
	
	====Занятие 0
	Нет информации...
	
	====Занятие 1
	Матрицы для систем можно вписывать так:
	
	{{{
	sys = ss('-1 2;0 -4', '1;2', '1 0;0 1', '0;0')
	или
	sys = ss([[-1, 2],[0, -4]], [[1],[2]], [[1, 0],[0, 1]], [[0],[0]])
	}}}
	
	Отличия от MATLAB
	|= MATLAB |= python-control |
	|rank(m)|**matrix_rank(m)**, не путать с rank(m)|
	|ss(A, B, C, D)|ss(A, B, C, D)|
	|rss(n, m, r)|нет, в любом случае чаще всего матрицы нам известны|
	|ctrb(sys)|ctrb(sys.A, sys.B)|
	|obsv(sys)|obsv(sys.A, sys.C)|
	|eig(sys)|eig(sys.A)|
	|tf(sys)|tf(sys), а также может пригодиться tfdata(sys)|
	|ltiview(sys)|Строить графики можно, но не так просто...|
	|dcgain(sys)|dcgain(sys)|
	| |sys.inputs - довольно удобно, можно узнать кол-во входов не глядя на матрицы|
	| |sys.outputs|
	| |sys.states|
	
	====Занятие 2
	Поскольку подобия simulink в python-control конечно же нет, на следующих занятиях придется использовать **Scilab**.
	
	===Scilab
	Большая часть функций совпадает в той или иной мере с MATLAB, что на самом деле обидно, все-таки лучше бы они в чем-то брали пример с Sage.
	
	====Установка
	{{{
	apt-get install scilab # что может быть проще? :)
	}}}
	===Занятие 0
	Если что-то здесь не указано, значит оно полностью совпадает с синтаксисом MATLAB (ну или я просто забыл что-то написать).
	Все следующие команды перечислены относительно PDF файлов занятий, выложенных [[http://www.dcc.ttu.ee/las/materjalid.htm здесь]].
	
	|= MATLAB |= scilab |
	|eig(A)|spec(A)|
	|poly(A)|poly(A, 'x')|
	|p2 = [1 -2 0 5]|p2 = poly([5 0 -2 1], 'x', 'c') - коэффициенты в обратную сторону. Если не указать третим параметром 'c', тогда первый массив является списком корней|
	|conv(p1, p2)|p1*p2|
	
	===Занятие 1
	|= MATLAB |= scilab |
	|ss(A, B, C, D)|syslin('c',A,B,C[,D]) для непрерывных, syslin('d',A,B,C[,D]) для дискретных|
	|rss(n, m, r)|ssrand(**m, r, n**) - обратите внимание на порядок параметров|
	|ctrb(sys)|cont_mat(sys)|
	|obsv(sys)|obsv_mat(sys)|
	|eig(sys)|spec(sys.A)|
	|tf(sys)|ss2tf(sys)|
	|dcgain(sys)|?|
	|ltiview(sys)|? Смотри ниже|
	
	Построить графики можно примерно так:
	{{{
	t=0:0.01:15
	y1 = csim('stem', t, sys)
	plot(t, y1)
	}}}
	
	===Занятие 2
	|eye(4)|eye(4,4)|
	|eig(sys)|spec(sys.A)|
	|c2d(sys,0.1)|cls2dls(sys,0.1)|
	|place|ppol|
	|simulink|xcos|
	
	===xcos
	Код можно писать в **Simulation/Set context**, как использовать переменные из основного окна - я не понял.
	
	Всё остальное так же, как и в MATLAB. Вот некоторые жлементы, которые могут вам пригодиться:
	
	 * Continuous time systems/CLSS - очевидно
	 * Discrete time systems/DLSS - тоже очевидно
	 * Mathematical Operations/GAIN_f - пригодится при обратной связи.
	 * Sources/CLOCK_c для тактирования CSCOPE и дискретных систем.
	 * Sinks/CSCOPE для просмотра
	 * Signal Routing/MUX и DEMUX - вряд ли пригодятся, но если что, то они тут.
	 * Continuous time systems/TIME_DELAY и Discrete time systems/DELAY_f - Иногда при использовании обратной связи можно увидеть ошибку "Algebraic loop". Чтобы её обойти, поставьте небольшой delay в обратную связь.
	
	Выглядеть это будет примерно вот так:
	... ?
	
	Сразу советую в Simulation/Setup выставить маленький Final integration time, например 30, так как нас будет интересовать лишь начало симуляции.
	
	===Занятие 3
	Всё примерно то же самое, что и в занятии 2.
